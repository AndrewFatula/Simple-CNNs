# Simple-CNNs

In this Repository you can find implementations of:

1.Simple example of using CNN on Mnist digits dataset in file mnist_torch_nn.py 

2.Similiar example of CNN using custom residual convolution layers on EMNIST dataset (extended mnist) in file Emnist_torch.ipynb, dataset contains digits and letters.Practical implementation of this CNN in form of windows executable application that can recognize handwritter uppercase letter and digits, you can download application on this link: https://drive.google.com/open?id=1IOoElJ2LA8Id6z6vvgYN4l6Bwx7meTaN .
