# Simple-CNNs

In this Repository you can find implementations of:

1.Simple example of using CNN on Mnist digits dataset in file mnist_torch_nn.py 

2.Similiar example of using CNN on EMNIST dataset (extended mnist), dataset contains digits and letters.

3.Practical implementation of CNN trained on EMNIST dataset in form of windows application that can recognize handwritter uppercase letter and digits, you can download application on this link: https://drive.google.com/open?id=1IOoElJ2LA8Id6z6vvgYN4l6Bwx7meTaN .
